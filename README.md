## THE SYSTEM

NorthPharma does not only move cold medicine and cold air. It moves the cabinets:
the reagent lockers, the sample stores, the sealed rooms where a few degrees and a
few grams decide whether a batch is medicine or evidence. The industrial tamper
system is the ring of sensors on those cabinets. Each node watches a door, a
panel, or a lid; each node reports an intrusion, and each node shares a radio.

A tamper node is a simple machine. A cabinet-temperature sensor reports the
space, a mesh gateway authorizes a tamper command, the controller decides, a
shutter latch locks or releases the cabinet, and an annunciator says whether the
node is secure. The failure that matters is not a wrong number on a screen. It is
a latch that opens when no one asked, or a whole ring of latches that stops
trusting the gateway and starts trusting a frame that says IRONWEB.

The node in this repository is that hand. On a breadboard it is a toy: a Pico 2,
a servo that acts as the shutter latch, a DHT11 that stands in for the cabinet
temperature sensor, an infrared remote that is the local arm/disarm control, a
button that is the manual arm request, a 1602 LCD that is the tamper readout,
three lamps, and a radio that is the mesh link.

Nothing about it looks broken. That is the horror of Act V. The code compiles,
the tests pass, the annunciator is green, and one node is quietly teaching every
neighbor to carry the same frame.

<br>

## THE STAKES

Act I was a lie about temperature. Act II was a lie about people. Act III was a
lie about machinery. Act IV was a lie about remediation. Act V is a lie about
containment, and it is the first lie that gets stronger the more nodes you deploy.

The node is weaponized, not buggy. A hidden implant listens for a magic frame and
re-emits it to the mesh, and the mesh repeats it. Isolation is the only real
remediation for a worm, and the entire point of the act is that "one clean node"
is not a clean network. In a mesh, every node is a router, and every router that
believes a frame is a new source of that frame.

And here is the part that keeps the responders awake. The tamper command path is
already authenticated. The cryptography is real and it is correct. The worm does
not break the cipher. It does something worse: it does not need the cipher at
all. It listens to the raw payload before authentication, it never presents a
sealed envelope, and it propagates over the same radio the sealed traffic uses.
You cannot patch a protocol if the attacker is underneath the protocol, and you
cannot quarantine a mesh by cleaning one chassis.

That is not a tamper ring. That is a tamper ring with a contagion.

<br>

## WHITEOUT

WHITEOUT is a resistance that does not exist on paper. It does not hold ground
and it does not hold press conferences. It reads firmware. When NIGHTINGALE
copied the shipping image and went quiet, the crew kept pulling the thread. The
gate led to the pipeline. The pipeline led to the plant. The plant led to the
air, and the air led to the cabinets.

NIGHTINGALE is still the thread. Her last verified copy came off the HVAC node,
and it was clean. The thing that came after it was not. Somewhere between the
build server and the rack, someone signed a tamper image that carries a worm, and
that image is holding a ring of cabinets right now.

WHITEOUT's job in Act V is not to break in. It is to prove the machine is already
contagious, in writing, with a debugger and a disassembler, then to break the
propagation, clear the infection marker, and seal the command path so the frame
cannot travel again.

<br>

## THE MACHINE

The firmware in this repository is the node's firmware. On a breadboard it is a
toy: a Pico 2, an SG90 servo that is the shutter latch, a DHT11 that is the
cabinet temperature sensor, a VS1838B infrared eye that takes a local arm/disarm
remote, a 1602 LCD tamper readout over I2C, red/yellow/green annunciator lamps, a
manual arm button, and an RYLR998 LoRa mesh link to a gateway.

Two things are open, and one thing is not what it seems. **The optical surface**
takes an arm or disarm command from any NEC remote, and it is not authenticated.
**The radio** carries the sealed tamper command path, and it is authenticated
correctly. The part that is not what it seems is the **implant**: a module
compiled only under a build flag called `SANDBOX_ONLY`, invisible in the clean
firmware, and present in the test and CTF builds. It listens on the mesh, it
writes an infection marker, and it re-emits its frame to the next node.

The face of the thing is honest in the way that matters least. The lamps say
INTRUSION, ARMED, and SECURE with total confidence, and the LCD shows the state,
the link, the zone, and the infection. None of it lies. A healthy mesh of hostile
nodes can still look like a healthy mesh.

<br>

## THE JOB

You do not have to be a hero. You have to be thorough. The ring is carrying a
passenger that no design review admitted to, and the passenger makes copies. Find
it, prove it, and cut the web.

1. **Bring it up.** Build the clean firmware, wire the board, and confirm the
   node reads the cabinet temperature, takes a local arm request, reaches the
   gateway, and drives the latch. Nothing looks broken because nothing is broken
   yet.
2. **Inspect the protocol.** Capture a sealed tamper command and read the body
   byte by byte. Understand what is authenticated and what the worm ignores.
3. **Hunt the worm.** Build the `SANDBOX_ONLY` image and find the `IRONWEB`
   frame, the propagation loop, the reserved-sector infection marker, and the
   anti-debug trap. A single clean reflash will not cut the web.
4. **Defuse it.** Break the propagation, clear the marker, and step past the
   anti-debug with GDB so the worm cannot tell that a probe is attached. Then
   seal the alert path so no untrusted frame is ever re-broadcast.

This document is the manual for the job. Work it on a breadboard. When every
green lamp is lit and the log says the ring is clean, remember what it is: not a
healthy network. An infected one that has learned to hide.

Goodbye, friend.

<br>

## A NOTE ON THE ROADMAP

This project is Act V of **OPERATION COLD IRON**. Act I was the sensor
([cold-chain-monitor](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/cold-chain-monitor)). Act
II was the door ([access-gate](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/access-gate)).
Act III was the valve
([pipeline-valve-controller](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/pipeline-valve-controller)).
Act IV was the air
([hvac-automation-node](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/hvac-automation-node)).
Act V is the web. All five are defended devices; the companion CTF repository
ships the compromised one. The investigation lives here:

- [OPERATION IRON WEB CTF](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/CTF_industrial-tamper-system)

The CTF is the red half, weaponized: six deep tasks, each with static analysis, a
dynamic proof under GDB, a hardware demonstration, and an in-place, same-size
patch. This repository is the defended device. The CTF repository is the breached
one. The full story lives at
[github.com/mytechnotalent/industrial-tamper-system](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/industrial-tamper-system).

## WHERE THIS FITS: OPERATION COLD IRON

This repository is **Act V (IRON WEB)** of the ten-act OPERATION COLD IRON saga.
The malware track began in Act III; in Act IV it became persistence, and here it
becomes propagation. The full spine is in [SAGA.md](SAGA.md).

## THE MINISTRY

The Ministry runs the state: the surveillance, the cold chain, the gates, the
pipelines, the air, and the cabinets that hold what the state does not discuss.
NorthPharma is one of its deniable industrial fronts, and FROSTLINE is the
contractor that does the work no Ministry letterhead will admit to. FROSTLINE did
not break into this node; it built the worm, taught it to listen for a magic frame
and to hand the frame to its neighbors, signed the image, and moved on. Against
them is WHITEOUT, and the engineer who copied the first image, NIGHTINGALE. This
act is one ring of the Ministry's industrial edge. TELESCREEN, the surveillance
backbone that watches it, comes after the ten.

An adversarial, evidence-based audit of this act, including its honest
limitations, is in [NATION-STATE-REVIEW.md](NATION-STATE-REVIEW.md).


<br>

## How This Project Fits the Embedded Hacking Course

This repository is the Act V capstone integration for the
[Embedded Hacking](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Embedded-Hacking) course. It
reuses the entire Act I peripheral set so one breadboard serves the whole
foundation, and it adds the concepts the later acts build toward: a payload that
listens on the raw mesh before authentication, a propagation loop that makes one
node a source for the next, a reserved-sector infection marker, re-install on
boot, and the blue-half controls that contain them.

Each earlier module teaches one peripheral or language concept in isolation; this
project wires several of them into a single, tested product, and then teaches you
to look at that product as an adversary sees it.

| Embedded Hacking module | Concept you learn | Where it lives here |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Week 1: Introduction, Ethics, Scoping | Authorized lab work | Every lab is self-contained and authorized by design |
| Week 3: RP2350 Architecture and Firmware Analysis | Bare-metal targets, ELF/UF2, SWD | Pico SDK build, `build/*.uf2`, Debug Probe flash via OpenOCD |
| Weeks 4-6: Variables, Integers/Floats, Static | Data types, GPIO | `src/monitor.c` state machine, LED on GP25 |
| Week 7: Constants with 1602 LCD I2C | I2C bus, HD44780 commands | `src/display.c` |
| Week 9: Operators with DHT11 | Bit operations, edge timing | `src/sensor.c` cabinet temperature sensor |
| Week 11: Structures and Functions | Modular design | `include/*.h` and `src/*.c` module boundaries |
| This project adds | Mesh propagation, raw-frame listening, reserved flash sectors, boot-time re-install, UART AT driver, LoRa tamper path, anti-replay, authenticated state, fail-safe policy, malware analysis, anti-debug evasion, strict testing | `src/implant.c`, `src/latch.c`, `src/control.c`, `src/tamper_auth.c`, `src/radio.c`, `scripts/gateway.py`, `scripts/spoof.py`, `test/` |

If you have not worked through Weeks 7 and 9 yet, do those first: this project
assumes you are comfortable with I2C wiring and one-wire edge timing.

<br>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter and its labs you will be able to:

- Explain why a network of individually defended devices can still be defeated by
  a single frame, and why propagation is a different failure class from
  persistence or privilege.
- Wire and drive a 1602 LCD through a PCF8574 I2C backpack and render a tamper
  state, mesh link, zone, and infection readout.
- Decode a VS1838B infrared receiver as a local arm/disarm remote for ARM,
  DISARM, and CLEAR commands, and explain why an unauthenticated optical surface
  is still an attack surface and must not silently bypass authorization.
- Drive an SG90 shutter latch with 50 Hz PWM and explain why a 1000uF bulk
  capacitor is not optional.
- Read a DHT11 cabinet temperature sensor and classify the space against a safe
  band before the latch is allowed to move.
- Design a sealed tamper command path over a sub-GHz LoRa link using a
  fixed-size envelope, a guarded command set, a bounded zone band, a monotonic
  anti-replay window, and a keyed state tag.
- Analyze a propagating implant: locate the `IRONWEB` magic frame, explain the
  propagation loop, find the reserved-sector infection marker, and read the
  anti-debug trap.
- Explain why breaking propagation, clearing the infection marker, and sealing
  the command path are three separate controls, and why a firmware reflash alone
  is not enough.
- Defeat an anti-debug check under GDB by understanding the CoreDebug `DHCSR`
  register at `0xE000EDF0`.
- Apply blue-half controls: sealed and authorized commands, a local arm request
  that asks for authorization, fail-safe behavior, no re-broadcast of untrusted
  frames, and containment for the worm.
- Derive a key with Argon2id, seal every frame with XChaCha20-Poly1305, and read
  and run a native host test suite with hardware mocks and line coverage.

## Background

### Why industrial tamper monitoring

A chassis-intrusion ring is a control loop with many doors in it. A cabinet
sensor reports the space, a mesh gateway authorizes a tamper command, a
controller decides, a latch locks or releases the cabinet, and a gateway logs
what happened. The latch is where the decision becomes physical. Everything
interesting in physical security happens in that transition from a command to a
motion.

Three properties have to hold at once, and they are not the same property:

- **Integrity.** The command that reaches the latch is the command the gateway
  authorized. Not a replay, not a forgery, not a stray zone.
- **Authority.** The node acts only on an authorized verdict. A local arm button
  or remote is a request, not an authorization.
- **State.** The controller knows whether it is secure, armed, alerting, or
  faulted, and it does not trust a stale or tampered verdict.

Act V adds a fourth property that no single node can provide from the inside:
**propagation resistance**. A node is not contained if a frame it accepts is
re-emitted by every node around it. In a mesh, the unit of defense is the
network, not the board.

### Why integrity plus authority plus propagation resistance matter

The classic naive controller collapses the three. It accepts any command on the
radio, it has no anti-replay window, and it lets a local input bypass the
decision. Act II showed what that costs a door. Act III showed the industrial
version. Act IV showed the persistence version. Act V adds the network failure:

- **Integrity without exclusivity.** The sealed command path in this build is
  correct. XChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticates every frame, the zone band is
  bounded, the sequence window rejects a replay, and the state tag detects a
  tampered verdict. None of that stops an implant that reads the raw payload
  before the envelope is opened.
- **Authority as the attack goal.** A worm does not need to steal anything. It
  needs one node to accept a frame and hand it on. Replication is the whole
  payload.
- **State as the last line of defense.** A keyed tag over the authorization
  record means a debugger that rewrites the record is caught before the latch
  moves. It is the same lesson Act II taught, carried into the tamper ring.
- **Propagation as the containment trap.** A payload that survives a reflash has
  a copy outside the image. A payload that spreads has a copy outside the board.
  A clean reflash is a local action against a network problem, which is why the
  fix is not only a patch; it is a patch plus the erasure of the marker plus the
  removal of the re-broadcast.

The fix track in Lab 4 seals the command path, makes the local arm request ask
for authorization, and stops the node from re-broadcasting an untrusted frame.
The malware track in Lab 3 breaks the propagation, exposes the marker, and
removes the passenger that was never in the design.

### Why ChaCha20 over AES on the RP2350

The RP2350 has no hardware AES engine; its accelerated crypto block covers
SHA-256, not AES. A software AES implementation on this part is therefore both
slower and riskier, because table-driven AES performs data-dependent memory
accesses that create a cache-timing side channel. ChaCha20 is built only from
addition, rotation, and XOR, with no data-dependent table lookups, so it is fast
in portable C and has no comparable cache-timing surface. XChaCha20-Poly1305 is
thus both the modern choice and the pragmatic one for this silicon. The full
rationale, including the extended-nonce benefit, appears in
[The Cryptographic Envelope](#the-cryptographic-envelope).

### The two on-wire problems this project solves

1. **Payloads that contain commas.** The sealed body is carried as lowercase hex,
   but the `+RCV` framing still separates fields with commas. A naive receiver
   that splits the line on the first comma corrupts the frame. The correct
   discipline is the **declared-length** rule: slice exactly `L` characters after
   the second comma and require the next character to be a comma.
2. **Telling a real command from a forged or replayed one.** The controller
   records the sender address exactly as the radio reports it, and it trusts the
   bytes that arrive. The sealed envelope, the bounded zone band, and the
   stateful window are what close that gap.

### Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

I2C is a two-wire bus: **SDA** (data) and **SCL** (clock), each pulled up to the
supply rail. A controller (the Pico) addresses a target by its 7-bit address and
writes or reads bytes. The 1602 LCD backpack carries a **PCF8574** I/O expander
at address `0x27`; the firmware bit-bangs the HD44780 nibble protocol over that
expander. Pull-ups are mandatory: the firmware enables the internal ones and the
backpack usually adds its own.

### The DHT11 one-wire protocol

The DHT11 is a low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. In Act V it is
the **cabinet temperature sensor**: the node classifies the space against a safe
band as part of its tamper verdict. It speaks a custom single-wire protocol:

1. The host pulls the line low for at least 18 ms (the **start pulse**), then
   releases it and enables its pull-up.
2. The sensor answers with an 80 us low, then an 80 us high handshake.
3. The sensor sends **40 bits**. Each bit begins with a 50 us low, then a high
   pulse whose width encodes the value: about 26-28 us for a `0`, about 70 us
   for a `1`.
4. Five bytes follow: humidity integer, humidity decimal, temperature integer,
   temperature decimal, and a checksum equal to the low byte of their sum.

Reading it means timing edges on the order of tens of microseconds, so the
firmware uses an 18 ms host pulse, a 50 us bit-classification threshold, and a
240 us per-edge timeout so a dead or unplugged sensor fails fast instead of
hanging the loop. A reading that fails its checksum is never safe, and a valid
reading outside **0.0 C to 40.0 C** (the tenths band `0` to `400`) is out of
band. Either way, the space is not nominal.

### Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) and AT commands

The RYLR998 is driven over a UART at 115200 baud using CRLF-terminated ASCII
commands. The firmware writes `AT+SEND=...` and drains inbound `+RCV=...` lines.
Because the radio is a separate processor, its configuration (address, network
identifier, band) persists until changed; the controller and the gateway each
provision their own radio at start-up so they agree before any command traffic
flows.

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

`src/crc.c` implements CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE (`poly = 0x1021`, `init = 0xFFFF`,
check value `0x29B1` for `"123456789"`). It is provided as a reusable integrity
diagnostic and exercised by the test suite. It is **not** part of the LoRa frame
in this project; the lesson is the *absence* of authentication, not the absence
of a checksum.

## System Architecture

There are four roles:

| Role | Runs on | Job |
| ---- | ------- | --- |
| **Tamper node** | Pico 2 firmware | Decodes the infrared arm/disarm remote, verifies sealed gateway tamper commands, annunciates INTRUSION, reads the cabinet temperature, drives the shutter latch, enforces the manual arm request, renders the tamper readout, and (SANDBOX_ONLY) runs the worm |
| **Mesh gateway** | laptop + USB-TTL radio | Authenticates every request, logs it to `tamper_log.csv`, decides authorization, and answers with a sealed tamper command carrying a sequence and a state tag (`scripts/gateway.py`) |
| **Edge simulator** | laptop + USB-TTL radio | Pretends to be a node and sends sealed zone requests (`scripts/sim_edge.py`) |
| **Attacker** | laptop + USB-TTL radio | Impersonates the gateway, forges a command, or replays a captured command (`scripts/spoof.py`) |

## The Wire Protocol

### Request frame

The local arm control, or the edge simulator, seals a two-byte zone into an
authenticated envelope and sends it to the mesh gateway:

```text
AT+SEND=0001,<len>,<hex envelope>
```

The plaintext of a request is exactly two bytes: an `int16` zone identifier in
little-endian.

### Command frame

The gateway answers an authenticated request with a sealed tamper command. The
command plaintext is a 23-byte body:

```text
seq[4] (little-endian) || command[1] || zone[2] (little-endian) || tag[16]
```

- `seq` is the monotonic gateway sequence number.
- `command` is one of the guarded tamper commands: `TAMPER_COMMAND_ALERT`
  (`0x01`), `TAMPER_COMMAND_ARM` (`0x02`), or `TAMPER_COMMAND_SECURE` (`0x03`).
  Any other command byte is refused.
- `zone` is the authorized zone in the provisioning band `TAMPER_ZONE_MIN` (`0`)
  to `TAMPER_ZONE_MAX` (`16`).
- `tag` is an XChaCha20-Poly1305 tag over the authorization record the command
  would produce, so the controller can verify that the verdict it is about to
  store is the one the gateway authorized.

The gateway sends it back to the claimed sender address:

```text
AT+SEND=<node>,<len>,<hex envelope>
```

The firmware enforces the guard in `control_parse`: the recovered command byte
must be in the guarded tamper set, and the recovered zone must be inside the
provisioning band. Anything else is rejected before it can reach the latch
decision. This is the sealed replacement for the old unauthenticated arm
injection.

### Sealed envelope layout

Every payload on the wire is the lowercase hexadecimal encoding of:

```text
nonce[24] || ciphertext[L] || tag[16]
```

For a two-byte request body this is 24 + 2 + 16 = 42 bytes, or 84 hex
characters. For a 23-byte command body this is 24 + 23 + 16 = 63 bytes, or 126
hex characters. The declared length `L` in the `AT+SEND` and `+RCV` framing is
the length of the hex string, not of the underlying plaintext.

The maximum accepted plaintext is 48 bytes (`ENVELOPE_MAX_PLAINTEXT`), and the
maximum hex envelope buffer is `(24 + 48 + 16) * 2 + 1 = 177` bytes
(`ENVELOPE_MAX_HEX_LEN`), which fits the 256-byte radio command and receive
buffers with framing headroom.

### Declared-length slicing invariant

Given the substring `T` after the second comma:

```text
C = T[0 : L]   and   T[L] == ","
```

The receiver checks `T[L] == ","`, so a mismatch between the declared length and
the actual payload is a parse error rather than silent corruption. This is what
makes hex-bearing payloads safe to carry and is the same invariant Act I uses.

### Tamper status readout

```text
ST:SECURE  L:UP
ZN:0 I:--
```

Line 1 is the current latch state (`SECURE`, `ARMED`, `ALERT`, or `FAULT`) and
the gateway link (`UP` or `--`). Line 2 is the active zone and the infection
status. In the clean build the infection field is always `--`. In the
`SANDBOX_ONLY` build the infection field is `INF` once the reserved-sector marker
is present. When an intrusion alert is active, the red lamp is lit; when the node
is armed or an arm request is pending, the yellow lamp is lit; otherwise the
green lamp is lit. Exactly one status LED is lit at a time.

### Radio provisioning

For the link to work, both radios must share the same **network identifier** and
each must have the address the other targets:

- Firmware sets its own radio: `AT+ADDRESS=7`, `AT+NETWORKID=18`.
- `gateway.py` sets the gateway radio: `AT+ADDRESS=1`, `AT+NETWORKID=18`.

Both radios must also be the **same band variant** (for example 915 MHz or
868 MHz); band and RF parameters are left at factory defaults, so use matching
modules.

### Timing

| Quantity | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Gateway link timeout (`TAMPER_ALERT_WAIT_MS`) | 5000 ms |
| Latch travel time (`LATCH_TRAVEL_MS`) | 1000 ms |
| Manual arm debounce (`ARM_DEBOUNCE_US`) | 30000 us |
| DHT11 host start pulse | 18000 us |
| DHT11 bit threshold | 50 us |
| DHT11 per-edge timeout | 240 us |
| LCD I2C clock | 100000 Hz |
| Radio UART baud | 115200 |
| Cabinet temperature band | 0 to 400 tenths (0.0 C to 40.0 C) |
| Zone band | 0 to 16 |
| Fail-safe zone | 0 |
| Latch closed pulse | 500 us |
| Latch open pulse | 1500 us |
| Servo PWM period | 20000 us (50 Hz) |
| Worm propagation interval | 4 ticks |
| Worm frame length | 11 bytes |

<br>

## The Cryptographic Envelope

The radio is the first open path, and it is one a key can close. The fix is
authenticated encryption: every request and every command is sealed so a forged
frame dies at the authentication tag instead of moving the latch. The full
implementation lives in `src/chacha20.c`, `src/poly1305.c`, and
`src/crypto_aead.c`, and every primitive is checked against its published test
vectors in the native suite.

### Why XChaCha20-Poly1305

- **256-bit key, 192-bit nonce.** The extended nonce means nonces can be drawn at
  random forever, so the controller never needs a shared counter that a reboot
  could reuse.
- **AEAD in one pass.** Confidentiality and integrity come from one operation;
  the associated data (the tamper node id, byte `0x07`) is authenticated even
  though it is not encrypted.
- **Constant-time software.** ChaCha20 has no data-dependent table lookups, so it
  has no cache-timing surface. The RP2350 has no hardware AES engine (it
  accelerates SHA-256 only), which makes software AES both slower and riskier on
  this silicon.
- **128-bit Poly1305 tag.** Guessing a valid tag succeeds with probability
  2^-128.

### Why Argon2id

A passphrase is not a key. Argon2id (RFC 9106) is the memory-hard password hash:
it mixes the passphrase with a salt across memory and time so an attacker cannot
cheaply recover the field passphrase from a captured image. The classroom profile
is `t=3`, `p=1`, `m=64` blocks (`CRYPTO_KDF_TIME_COST`,
`CRYPTO_KDF_PARALLELISM`, `CRYPTO_KDF_MEMORY_BLOCKS`) to fit the RP2350 SRAM
budget. Raise it on the mesh gateway. The lab salt is the 16 ASCII bytes
`coldiron-salt-01`.

### Key model: one field key

Act V uses a single field key derived with Argon2id from a committed lab
passphrase and salt. It seals every frame on the wire and it computes the state
tag over the authorization record. In the classroom build the firmware and the
gateway derive the same key, so they interoperate with no provisioning step. That
is a lab convenience, not a deployment.

The design keeps the key roles separable so students can reason about the real
lifecycle: derive, provision per device, use, rotate on a schedule, and retire. A
production build provisions key material from one-time-programmable (OTP) memory,
keeps the state-tag key off the field device where possible, and rotates without
reflashing every controller.

### Envelope layout

The sealed frame is carried as hex inside the `AT+SEND` payload:

```text
nonce[24] || ciphertext[L] || tag[16]
```

The receiver recomputes the Poly1305 tag over the associated data and ciphertext,
compares it in constant time, and only then decrypts. This envelope is wired end
to end: `src/control.c` opens the command with `src/envelope.c`, and the gateway
authenticates before it parses or acts. Authenticated frames carry the tamper
node id as associated data, so a frame sealed for one node cannot be relabeled
for another.

### Anti-replay and authenticated state

Strong AEAD is necessary and not sufficient. Two stateful controls sit on top:

- **Anti-replay sequence window.** `src/tamper_auth.c` keeps `last_seq`, the
  highest sequence number ever accepted. `tamper_auth_apply` accepts a command
  only when its sequence is strictly greater than `last_seq`. A captured command,
  even a perfectly valid one, is rejected on second use.
- **Authenticated state tag.** The authorization record is nine bytes:
  `granted[1]`, `seq[4]`, `last_seq[4]`. The tag is an XChaCha20-Poly1305 tag
  over that record, computed under the field key with a deterministic nonce built
  from the sequence number and the domain byte `0xA7`. `tamper_auth_state_ok`
  recomputes the tag and compares it in constant time before the latch is allowed
  to move. A debugger that sets `granted = true` without recomputing the tag
  fails here first.

The sequence window and the state tag are independent. The window stops a valid
command from working twice; the tag stops an unauthorized verdict from existing
at all.

<br>

## The FROSTLINE Worm

Act V carries the propagation lesson, and the worm is the reason. It is real in
technique and inert in effect: it runs on your breadboard, it transmits on your
radio, and it writes to a reserved flash sector that holds nothing else. It is
compiled only when `SANDBOX_ONLY` is defined, so the clean firmware image contains
no implant at all. The test suite and the companion CTF build with `SANDBOX_ONLY`
and with the host mock, so every implant path is exercised natively.

What the worm does, in the order the code does it:

1. **First run and reserved sector.** `implant_init` reads the marker byte at
   `TAMPER_IMPLANT_RESERVE_ADDR` (`0x103FF000`), the final sector of external
   flash. On the first run the marker is absent, so the implant erases the sector
   and programs `0xC7` (`TAMPER_IMPLANT_MARKER_BYTE`) with the Pico SDK flash
   API once. On every later boot the marker is
   present, so the implant re-arms its payload handler. A firmware reflash that
   writes the program region does not touch the reserved sector, so the worm
   comes back even when the code is gone.
2. **The IRONWEB frame.** The worm magic is the 7-byte preamble `IRONWEB`
   (`TAMPER_IMPLANT_WORM_MAGIC`). One frame is 11 bytes
   (`TAMPER_IMPLANT_WORM_LEN`): the 7-byte magic, then a 4-byte synthetic status
   body that carries the marker byte `0xC7`, the low and high bytes of the tick
   counter, and a byte that reports whether a probe is attached. The frame
   carries no real data and targets no external address.
3. **Propagation.** `implant_tick` advances a tick counter. While the node is
   infected and no probe is attached, every
   `TAMPER_IMPLANT_PROPAGATE_INTERVAL_TICKS` (4) ticks the worm builds the
   `IRONWEB` frame and emits it over the LoRa mesh link. A peer that receives the
   frame and runs the same handler matches the magic, infects itself, and emits
   the frame again, so the infection walks the ring one hop at a time.
4. **Magic handler.** `implant_handle_command` matches the exact 7-byte magic on
   the raw inbound payload, before the sealed command path ever sees it. On a
   match, and when no probe is attached, the handler arms the payload, writes the
   infection marker, and propagates immediately.
5. **Anti-debug.** Every tick the worm reads the CoreDebug `DHCSR` register at
   `0xE000EDF0` (`TAMPER_IMPLANT_DHCSR_ADDR`). Bit 0 is `C_DEBUGEN` and bit 1 is
   `C_HALT`. If either bit is set, the worm returns early and suppresses both the
   propagation and the magic handler. It behaves like a well-mannered firmware
   module while a probe is attached, and it goes back to work the moment the
   probe is gone.
6. **Neutralization.** The worm exposes `implant_set_propagation` so the
   propagation gate can be closed, and the documented fix is three steps that
   must all happen: close the propagation gate, erase the reserved sector, and
   remove the code path and the `SANDBOX_ONLY` build flag.

The worm is bounded by construction and by test. It touches only its own mesh
frame, its arming latch, and the one reserved sector. It never opens a sealed
envelope, never calls the actuator, and never contacts an external address. There
is no network, no filesystem, and no host impact. `test_implant_init_first_run`,
`test_implant_reinstall_on_boot`, `test_implant_infected_marker`,
`test_implant_debug_attached`, `test_implant_propagation_flag`,
`test_implant_worm_match`, `test_implant_build_worm`, `test_implant_propagate_gate`,
`test_implant_handle_command`, `test_implant_propagates`, `test_implant_anti_debug`,
and `test_implant_tick_clean` assert exactly that behavior.

The honest limit is the point of the lab. A sanitized educational worm is still a
benign educational worm: it demonstrates the technique, not the tradecraft. It is
confined to the breadboard, guarded by `SANDBOX_ONLY`, and it propagates only
across the student's own nodes on the classroom network id. The real lesson is
containment and complete removal, and the defense is not a patch to the worm but
the closure of the propagation gate, the erasure of the reserved sector, and the
removal of the code path and the build flag that allowed it in.

| 4 | USB cables | Pico 2, Debug Probe, and serial adapter(s) |

### How many radios do you actually need?

| Goal | Radios | What is connected |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Legitimate sealed tamper loop (Labs 1-2) | **2** | 1x RYLR998 on the Pico (UART1) + 1x RYLR998 on a USB-to-TTL adapter (the gateway) |
| Live attack lab (Labs 3-4, watch a forged command land and fail) | **3** | the 2 above + 1x RYLR998 on a second USB-to-TTL adapter (the attacker) |
| Worm propagation demonstration with no extra hardware | 2 or 0 | watch the firmware emit the `IRONWEB` frame, or run the native unit tests |
| Attack concept with no extra hardware | 2 or 0 | read-and-run the offline parser demo, or the unit tests |

A radio never receives its own transmission, and the gateway radio is busy
listening as `gateway.py`, so the live attack needs a separate attacker radio.
The 2-radio kit runs the whole legitimate system; only the live attack
observation needs the third. The worm propagation lab is fully observable in the
firmware transmit path and in the native tests, because a single node emits the
frame it would hand to its neighbor.

> Serial adapter warning: the RYLR998 is **not** 5V tolerant. Use a
> **3.3V-logic** USB-to-TTL adapter (or set its jumper to 3.3V).

<br>

### How each part works

Every part in the bill of materials does one physical job and one job in this act:

| Part | How it works | Role in this act |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 1x Full-size breadboard (long) | The two columns of spring-clip tie points sit on a 0.1 inch grid, so every hole in a row is bridged by a metal clip, while the two outer power rails run the full length and distribute power and ground to the whole build. | It is the substrate that holds the Pico 2, LCD, sensor, servo, and radio headers and distributes 3.3V and 5V across the node. |
| 1x Assorted jumper wires (male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-female) | Male pins push into breadboard tie points or female headers, female sockets slide over the Pico 2, LCD, and servo header pins, and male-to-female leads bridge a breadboard row to a module header. | They carry power and the I2C, one-wire, UART, PWM, IR, and GPIO signals between the boards. |
| 1x Raspberry Pi Pico 2 with header | The RP2350 pairs two Arm Cortex-M33 cores with 3.3V logic and a GPIO block that exposes ADC, I2C, UART, and PWM, plus the onboard GP25 LED. | It is the tamper controller that reads the cabinet temperature, treats the IR and button inputs as requests, drives the shutter latch servo and annunciator, and runs the sealed guarded-state protocol. |
| 1x Raspberry Pi Pico Debug Probe | It drives the two-wire SWD port (SWCLK and SWDIO) to flash and single-step the target, and it also presents a USB UART bridge for the serial console. | It flashes and debugs the node and is the instrument for the Lab 3 worm analysis and the fix. |
| 2x USB A-male to USB micro-B cables | USB carries 5V power and a data channel on the same cable, so one cable powers the Pico 2 and presents its USB CDC console while the other powers the Debug Probe and carries its SWD and UART traffic. | They power the two boards and carry the console and debug links. |
| 3x 5mm LEDs (1 red, 1 green, 1 yellow) | An LED is a diode with a forward voltage drop of roughly 2V, so current flows only from the anode to the cathode, and a GPIO pin set high sources that current and lights the lamp. | They are the red INTRUSION, yellow ARMED, and green SECURE annunciator, and exactly one is lit per state. |
| 3x 100, 220, or 330 Ohm resistors | A resistor in series with each LED sets the current by Ohm's law, I equals (supply minus forward voltage) divided by resistance, which protects the LED and keeps the GPIO within its current limit. | One resistor per lamp limits the LED current on each of the three annunciator pins. |
| 1x Push button (tactile switch) | The switch shorts its input pin to ground when pressed, and the RP2350 internal pull-up holds that pin high at rest so the press reads as active low. | It is the manual arm request that raises ARMED and never moves the latch on its own. |
| 1x 1602 LCD with PCF8574 I2C backpack | The HD44780 controller takes a 4-bit nibble protocol with register-select and enable strobes, and the PCF8574 I2C expander latches those eight control lines so the whole display is driven over two I2C wires at address 0x27. | It renders the tamper status, zone, and infection readout. |
| 1x DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor | The host pulls the single data line low for a start pulse, then the sensor answers with 40 bits of humidity, temperature, and checksum timed by pulse widths, and the checksum must match. | It is the cabinet temperature sensor whose reading marks the space not nominal when it fails or leaves the 0.0 C to 40.0 C band. |
| 1x SG90 servo motor | The servo expects a 50 Hz PWM signal whose high pulse of 1 to 2 ms selects the shaft angle, and a Pico PWM slice generates that pulse train. | It is the shutter latch actuator, seated closed at 0 degrees and open for service at 90 degrees. |
| 1x 1000uF 25V capacitor | Wired across the servo 5V rail and ground, the capacitor is a bulk reservoir that supplies the motor inrush current and smooths the rail while the servo starts. | It keeps the latch move from browning out the RP2350 and resetting the node. |
| 1x Infrared (IR) receiver (VS1838B) | The receiver pairs a photodiode with a 38 kHz bandpass demodulator that ignores ambient light and outputs an active-low logic pulse for each IR burst. | It is the local arm/disarm remote input on GP5. |
| 1x Infrared (IR) remote controller (NEC-compatible) | The remote emits its bursts modulated at 38 kHz in the NEC frame, a 9 ms leader followed by 32 bits where the address and command are each sent with their bitwise complements for validation. | It is the local remote that raises the ARM `0x47` and DISARM `0x45` requests and sends CLEAR `0x46`. |
| 1x RYLR998 LoRa radio module | The module is configured and driven over UART with AT commands and carries sub-GHz LoRa packets, and its logic pins are 3.3V only so the radio must never see 5V. | It is the UART1 command and status link that carries the sealed frames between the node and the gateway, and it is the medium the worm would use to reach the next node; it is not 5V tolerant. |

## Wiring the Node

### Pin map

This is the authoritative map; it is identical to Acts I to IV and is defined in
`include/tamper_sys.h` and enforced by the test suite.

| Peripheral | Signal | Pico 2 GPIO |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| DHT11 cabinet temperature sensor | DATA (one-wire) | **GP4** |
| 1602 LCD (PCF8574) | SDA (I2C1) | **GP2** |
| 1602 LCD (PCF8574) | SCL (I2C1) | **GP3** |
| RYLR998 | RX <- Pico TX (UART1) | **GP8** |
| RYLR998 | TX -> Pico RX (UART1) | **GP9** |
| Infrared arm/disarm remote | OUT (VS1838B) | **GP5** |
| Shutter latch servo | PWM signal | **GP14** |
| Red INTRUSION LED | anode | **GP16** |
| Yellow ARMED LED | anode | **GP17** |
| Green SECURE LED | anode | **GP18** |
| Manual arm/disarm button | to ground | **GP15** |
| Onboard LED | heartbeat | GP25 |
| Debug Probe / UART0 console | TX | GP0 |
| Debug Probe / UART0 console | RX | GP1 |

> Note: GPIO 2/3 are the classic I2C1 pins used throughout the Embedded Hacking
> breadboard; this project's map matches that board because it is the same board.

### 1602 LCD with I2C backpack

| LCD backpack | Pico 2 |
| ------------ | ------ |
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| SDA | GP2 |
| SCL | GP3 |

### DHT11 cabinet temperature sensor

| DHT11 | Pico 2 |
| ----- | ------ |
| VCC | 3.3V |
| DATA | GP4 |
| GND | GND |

If your DHT11 has no onboard pull-up, add a **10K resistor between DATA and
3.3V**. The firmware also enables the internal pull-up, but the external resistor
makes reads far more reliable over jumper wires. The space is not nominal when the
sensor fails or reads outside `0.0 C` to `40.0 C`.

### Status LEDs

| LED | Pico 2 | Series resistor |
| --- | ------ | --------------- |
| Red (INTRUSION) | GP16 (anode) | 220-330 Ohm to GND |
| Yellow (ARMED) | GP17 (anode) | 220-330 Ohm to GND |
| Green (SECURE) | GP18 (anode) | 220-330 Ohm to GND |

Exactly one lamp is lit at a time. Red is an intrusion alert or a failed-safe
latch, yellow is an armed node or a pending arm request, and green is a secure
node.

**LED behavior**

| State | Lamp | Indication | Meaning |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| `TAMPER_OFF` | none | All dark | Defined but never selected; the live state machine always drives intrusion, armed, or secure. |
| `TAMPER_INTRUSION` | Red | Solid | An intrusion alert was accepted or the latch failed safe. |
| `TAMPER_ARMED` | Yellow | Solid | The node is armed, or an arm request is pending. |
| `TAMPER_SECURE` | Green | Solid | The node is secure and the latch is open for service. |

The three annunciator lamps are always solid; `status_led.c` never blinks them.
Exactly one lamp is lit at a time, and `TAMPER_OFF` leaves all three dark. The
onboard GP25 LED is initialized as an output and pulsed once per monitor tick by
the `monitor_heartbeat` helper, so the running node shows a steady heartbeat.

### Manual arm/disarm button

| Button | Pico 2 |
| ------ | ------ |
| Leg 1 | GP15 |
| Leg 2 | GND |

The firmware enables the internal pull-up, so **do not** connect 3.3V to the
button. The manual arm request is a local request, not an authorization: a press
raises the ARMED indication and never moves the latch on its own. Lab 4 explains
why the request must ask for authorization instead of silently bypassing it.

### SG90 shutter latch servo

| Servo | Pico 2 |
| ----- | ------ |
| Signal (orange) | GP14 |
| VCC (red) | 5V (VBUS) |
| GND (brown) | GND |

Solder the **1000uF capacitor** across the servo 5V and GND rails to absorb the
inrush current; without it the RP2350 can brown out when the latch moves. Seated
(closed) is 0 degrees and open is 90 degrees.

### Infrared receiver

| VS1838B | Pico 2 |
| ------ | ------ |
| OUT | GP5 |
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |

Point any NEC-compatible remote at the receiver. In Act V this is the **local
arm/disarm remote**, not a maintenance extra: the firmware decodes
`MONITOR_IR_ARM` (`0x47`), `MONITOR_IR_DISARM` (`0x45`), and `MONITOR_IR_CLEAR`
(`0x46`). There is no challenge and no secret on the optical surface, which is
why an arm command is treated as a request and not as an authorization.

**Using the remote**

Point the NEC remote at the VS1838B receiver on **GP5** and press a mapped button;
the receiver idles high and pulls low on a mark. Every valid frame prints its
mapped name and command byte, for example `ARM (0x47)`, on the console and drives
the arm request path.

| NEC command | Name | Action |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| `0x47` | `MONITOR_IR_ARM` | Raises an arm request (`g_request_pending`); it never changes the guarded state on its own. |
| `0x45` | `MONITOR_IR_DISARM` | Raises an arm request (`g_request_pending`); it never changes the guarded state on its own. |
| `0x46` | `MONITOR_IR_CLEAR` | Clears the pending arm request (`monitor_clear_request`). |

ARM and DISARM both raise the same pending request; the authorized command path
decides the final guarded state.

### RYLR998 LoRa radio

> The RYLR998 must be powered. Forgetting **VDD** is the single most common
> reason the link appears dead: the firmware prints while the radio sits silent.

| RYLR998 | Pico 2 |
| ------- | ------ |
| VDD | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| RXD | GP8 (Pico UART1 TX) |
| TXD | GP9 (Pico UART1 RX) |

Attach the antenna before transmitting. TX and RX are **crossed**: the radio's
RXD is the Pico's TX and vice versa.

### Debug Probe (recommended)

| Debug Probe | Pico 2 |
| ----------- | ------ |
| SWCLK | SWCLK (3-pin debug header) |
| SWDIO | SWDIO |
| GND | GND |
| UART TX | GP1 (Pico RX) |
| UART RX | GP0 (Pico TX) |
| GND | GND |

The firmware enables stdio on **both** UART0 (`115200`) and USB, so you can
watch boot output on the probe's console or on the Pico's own USB serial port.
The Debug Probe is also the instrument for the Lab 3 malware work: it is how you
watch the propagation, expose the infection marker, trigger the magic handler, and
step past the anti-debug trap.

### Peripherals used

Every part in the Act V bill of materials is exercised by the firmware:

| Peripheral | Role | Where it is used |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Red, yellow, green LEDs | Tri-color tamper node annunciator | `status_led.c` drives exactly one lamp per state |
| Manual arm/disarm button (GP15) | Local arm request | `button.c` consumes one debounced press in `monitor_handle_arm` |
| 1602 I2C LCD | Tamper status readout | `display.c` renders the formatted lines over I2C1 |
| DHT11 (GP4) | Cabinet temperature and humidity | `sensor.c` reads the one-wire frame every telemetry interval |
| SG90 servo (GP14) | Shutter latch actuator | `servo.c` drives the latch open and closed |
| 1000uF capacitor | Bulk decoupling on the servo 5V rail | Required to keep the RP2350 from browning out on servo moves |
| VS1838B IR receiver (GP5) | Local arm/disarm remote input | `ir_remote.c` captures and decodes the frame |
| NEC IR remote | ARM, DISARM, and CLEAR | Sends `0x47`, `0x45`, and `0x46` |
| RYLR998 (UART1) | LoRa command and status link | `radio.c` sends sealed frames and pumps inbound commands |
| Onboard GP25 LED | Monitor heartbeat indicator | Initialized as an output and pulsed once per monitor tick by `monitor_heartbeat` |
| Debug Probe | SWD flashing, UART0 console, and malware analysis | `stdio` is enabled on both UART0 `115200` and USB |

Every Act V peripheral is exercised, including the onboard GP25 LED heartbeat.

<br>

### How the functionality works

Every input feeds the state machine in `monitor_step`, every output is driven
once per tick, and the interactive console mirrors both over UART0 and USB. The DHT11 is sampled every two seconds, so one live status line appears
about every two seconds.

**What each input does**

| Input | Where | What the firmware does |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Infrared remote (VS1838B) | GP5 | Decodes the NEC frame and prints the mapped name and command byte, for example `ARM (0x47)`, `DISARM (0x45)`, or `CLEAR (0x46)`. ARM and DISARM only raise an arm request; CLEAR drops it. |
| Manual arm button | GP15 to GND | One debounced press raises the arm request and prints `BUTTON arm request -> pending authorization`. It never moves the latch on its own. |
| DHT11 cabinet sensor | GP4 | Reads temperature and humidity every tick and prints one live status line; a failed read prints the warning line instead. |
| RYLR998 LoRa link | UART1 GP8/GP9 | Pumps inbound `+RCV` lines and prints `RX from 0xNNNN, N bytes` for every report before the sealed command is verified. |

**What each output does**

| Output | Where | What it shows |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- |
| Red INTRUSION LED | GP16 | Solid on an intrusion alert or a failed-safe latch. |
| Yellow ARMED LED | GP17 | Solid while the node is armed or an arm request is pending. |
| Green SECURE LED | GP18 | Solid while the node is secure. Exactly one lamp is lit at a time and the annunciator never blinks. |
| 1602 I2C LCD | GP2/GP3 at `0x27` | Line 1 shows the state and link (`ST:SECURE L:--`); line 2 shows the zone and infection marker (`ZN:0 I:INF`). |
| SG90 shutter latch servo | GP14 | Seated closed at 0 degrees and open for service at 90 degrees. |
| Onboard GP25 LED | GP25 | Pulsed once per monitor tick as a heartbeat. |

## Build and Flash

### 1. Install toolchain prerequisites

- Pico SDK 2.2.0+
- ARM GNU toolchain (`arm-none-eabi`)
- CMake and Ninja
- Python 3.x
- GDB (`arm-none-eabi-gdb`) for the Lab 3 malware analysis

**Linux:**

```bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.pico-sdk/sdk/2.2.0"
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install cmake ninja arm-none-eabi-gcc python
export PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.pico-sdk/sdk/2.2.0"
```

**Windows:** install PowerShell, Visual Studio Build Tools, CMake, Ninja,
Python 3, and the ARM embedded toolchain.

### 2. Build the firmware

The clean firmware does **not** define `SANDBOX_ONLY`, so it ships no worm:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s && cmake --build build
```

To build the malware-track image with the worm compiled in, turn the option on:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-sandbox -G Ninja -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s -DSANDBOX_ONLY=ON && cmake --build build-sandbox
```

Build-time artifact guardrail:

- The build regenerates `packet_artifact.h` from
  `scripts/packet_artifact.json` before compiling.
- The build fails if the committed `include/packet_artifact.h` is stale relative
  to the JSON artifact.

Generated outputs:

- `build/industrial_tamper_system.elf` (primary firmware binary)
- `build/industrial_tamper_system.uf2` (UF2 for BOOTSEL/picotool)
- `build/industrial_tamper_system_app.elf` / `.uf2` (backward-compatible copies)

### 3. Flash the RP2350

**BOOTSEL (drag-and-drop):** hold BOOTSEL while plugging in USB, then:

```bash
cp build/industrial_tamper_system.uf2 /Volumes/RP2350/
```

**picotool:**

```bash
picotool load build/industrial_tamper_system.uf2 -fx
```

*(If `picotool` is not on your PATH, invoke it from
`$HOME/.pico-sdk/picotool/*/picotool/picotool`.)*

**Debug Probe (SWD):** with `openocd` installed you can flash and reset without
touching BOOTSEL:

```bash
openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2350.cfg \
  -c "program build/industrial_tamper_system.elf verify reset exit"
```

### 4. Watch the console

Open the UART0 console (Debug Probe) or the Pico's USB serial port at `115200`.
The firmware enables `stdio` on both, so either link shows the same interactive
console. On reset you should see the boot banner, the control hint, and the I2C
scan:

```text
=== OPERATION IRON WEB // ACT V TAMPER MESH ===
REMOTE: CH+ 0x47=ARM CH- 0x45=DISARM CH 0x46=CLEAR
BUTTON GP15: local arm request (needs authorization)
I2C scan:
  found 0x27
```

`found 0x27` confirms the LCD backpack answered on the I2C bus. If a peripheral
fails, the firmware prints `INIT FAIL` and stops.

**Live status and event lines**

Each reading cycle prints one compact status line with the sensor value, the
annunciator state and lamp, and the sequence number:

```text
CLIMATE t=223 h=410 ok=1 ST=SECURE LED=GREEN seq=7
```

Events print as they happen:

| Line | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `ARM (0x47)` | The infrared remote decoded a known command. |
| `BUTTON arm request -> pending authorization` | The local arm button was pressed. |
| `RX from 0x0001, 11 bytes` | The radio delivered an inbound frame. |
| `SENSOR read failed -> WARNING` | The DHT11 read failed and the climate can no longer be trusted. |

<br>

## Lab 1: Bring-Up and Verify

**Goal:** prove the node reads the cabinet temperature, drives the LCD, takes a
local arm request, reaches the gateway, and moves the latch.

1. Wire the node per the pin map and attach the antenna.
2. Build and flash the clean firmware.
3. Connect the gateway radio to the laptop and find its port (`/dev/cu.usbserial-*`
   on macOS, `/dev/ttyUSB*` on Linux).
4. Start the mesh gateway:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/gateway.py --port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX --baud 115200
   ```

5. Send a sealed zone request from the edge simulator, or seal one from a node.
   The gateway prints it, then answers with a sealed tamper command:

   ```text
   +OK
   +OK
   +RCV=7,84,<84 hex characters>,-11,10
   TAMPER seq=1 zone=4
   ```

6. The node turns yellow (ARMED) when an arm request is pending, receives the
   command, verifies the state tag and the anti-replay window, then drives the
   latch to the authorized position. Press the manual arm button at any time to
   raise an arm request.

**Checkpoint:** the LCD shows `ST:SECURE  L:UP` and `ZN:0 I:--`, one lamp is lit
after the latch settles, and `tamper_log.csv` gains one row per request:

```text
utc,sender,auth,zone,rssi_snr
2026-09-20T09:30:05+00:00,7,OK,4,"-11,10"
```

**Theory check:** why does a successful command prove the LCD initialized?
Because `monitor_init()` only returns true when every peripheral, including the
LCD, is ready; otherwise `main` prints `INIT FAIL` and never enters the loop.

<br>

## Lab 2: Inspect the Wire Protocol

**Goal:** see the sealed envelope and the declared-length rule in action.

1. Capture a full `+RCV` line from the console or the gateway log.
2. Confirm the declared length equals the number of hex characters between the
   second comma and the RSSI field.
3. Split the hex into three parts: the first 48 hex characters are the 24-byte
   nonce, the last 32 are the 16-byte tag, and everything between is the
   ciphertext of the request or command body.
4. Locate the payload, its declared length, and the two tail fields in
   `scripts/gateway.py` (`_rcv_parts` and `_split_payload`), and explain why
   finding the *first* comma would be a bug.
5. Challenge: for the 23-byte command body, identify the four bytes of the
   sequence number, the one command byte, the two zone bytes, and the sixteen
   bytes of the state tag.

**Checkpoint:** you can explain why a frame must be sliced by the number in the
declared length field, not by delimiter counting, and why the command byte and
the zone are range-checked against the guarded set and the bounded band before
they can reach the latch decision.

<br>

## Lab 3: The Malware Track

**Goal:** find the FROSTLINE worm, prove that it propagates, expose its infection
marker, and remove it for good. This is the propagation act, and this lab is its
heart.

> Safety: the worm is benign and confined to your breadboard. It transmits only
> to your own mesh nodes on the classroom network id, it actuates nothing, and it
> writes only the reserved sector at `0x103FF000`, on the same chip. There is no
> network, no filesystem, and no host impact.

### Build the implant image

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-sandbox -G Ninja -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s -DSANDBOX_ONLY=ON && cmake --build build-sandbox
```

The clean build does not define `SANDBOX_ONLY`; the test build and the companion
CTF build do. Compare the two binaries and explain why the worm symbols are
absent from the clean one.

### A: Find the worm frame and the propagation loop

1. Flash the `SANDBOX_ONLY` image and let it boot once. `implant_init` writes the
   `0xC7` marker into the reserved sector at `0x103FF000` on the first run.
2. Read the reserved sector with the Debug Probe or `picotool` and confirm the
   marker byte.
3. Watch the mesh link. Every 4 ticks the worm emits an 11-byte frame that begins
   with `IRONWEB`, followed by the marker `0xC7`, the tick counter bytes, and the
   probe flag.
4. Locate `implant_propagate` and `implant_tick`, and explain why a node that
   receives this frame infects itself and emits the frame again.

**The lesson:** the worm does not need the sealed command path, because it
listens to the raw payload underneath it.

### B: Break the propagation

1. Read `implant_handle_command` and `implant_tick`: both consult the
   propagation gate and the anti-debug check before they act.
2. Close the propagation gate with `implant_set_propagation(false)` and prove the
   node stops emitting the `IRONWEB` frame.
3. Prove the gate is the difference between a spreading node and a quiet one, and
   explain why closing the gate on one node does not clean a neighbor that is
   already infected.

**The lesson:** there is no single patch for a worm. You stop the emission and
you clean every node that already has the copy.

### C: Clear the infection marker

1. Read the marker at `0x103FF000` and confirm it is the `0xC7` byte.
2. Erase the reserved sector and prove the node comes up clean with the marker
   gone and the `I:` field on the LCD back to `--`.
3. Reflash only the firmware image (the clean image is ideal) and let the node
   boot again. Because the marker is gone, the worm does not re-install.
4. Explain why BOTH steps are required: the gate stops the emission, and the
   erasure removes the state that would re-arm a future boot.

**The lesson:** a worm has two copies, the one in the image and the one in the
state. You remove the loader and you remove the payload.

### D: Defeat the anti-debug with GDB

This is the dynamic-analysis trap. The worm reads CoreDebug `DHCSR` at
`0xE000EDF0`; bit 0 is `C_DEBUGEN` and bit 1 is `C_HALT`. While a probe is
attached, the worm suppresses both the magic handler and the propagation.

1. Start the controller under the Debug Probe:

   ```bash
   arm-none-eabi-gdb build-sandbox/industrial_tamper_system.elf
   (gdb) target extended-remote /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
   (gdb) monitor reset halt
   ```

2. Break in `implant_tick` and inspect `implant_debug_attached`. With a normal
   probe attached, it returns true, and the propagation stays silent.
3. Set a breakpoint after the anti-debug check, or clear the `DHCSR` debug bits
   in the debugger's view, and observe the `IRONWEB` frame resume on the mesh.
4. Prove the payload: with the trap bypassed, inject the `IRONWEB` magic on the
   raw frame and watch the node infect itself and emit the frame again.

**The lesson:** an anti-debug check is a branch, and every branch is a place to
stand. The correct neutralization is not to babysit the branch; it is to remove
the code and the state it reads.

### Malware-track checklist

- Locate the reserved-sector marker and explain the write-once first run.
- Identify the 7-byte `IRONWEB` magic, the 11-byte frame, and the 4-tick
  propagation interval.
- Show the propagation loop and break it with the propagation gate.
- Expose the raw-payload magic handler underneath the sealed command path.
- Read and explain the CoreDebug `DHCSR` anti-debug trap.
- Erase the reserved sector, remove the code path, and confirm the clean build is
  worm-free and marker-free.

<br>

## Lab 4: The Fix Track

**Goal:** seal the ring so the red half and the worm cannot do to you what they
did on the bench. Each control maps to a defect the earlier labs exposed.

### 1. Seal the tamper command path

The old design accepted an unauthenticated tamper command. Act V replaces it
with `src/control.c`: the request must open under the field key, the command byte
must be in the guarded tamper set, the zone must be inside the provisioning band,
and the sequence and state tag must pass `src/tamper_auth.c` before the command is
applied. Re-run the Lab 3 forged-command injection: the tag fails and the latch
does not move.

### 2. Arm authorization

The local arm request is an operator request, and it must not silently bypass
authorization. `monitor_handle_arm` and `monitor_apply_ir_command` raise
`g_request_pending`; they never move the latch on their own.
`monitor_apply_command` clears the pending indication only when an authorized
command arrives. Re-run the lab: press the manual arm button, then send a valid
sealed tamper command. The latch moves only from the authorized command, and the
yellow ARMED lamp returns to green only then.

### 3. No re-broadcast of untrusted frames

The propagation gate is the containment control. The production firmware
compiles the worm path out entirely, so an untrusted frame can never trigger a
re-broadcast (`monitor_implant_frame` is a no-op in the clean build). The lesson
is that a control node must never relay a frame it did not itself authorize,
because a mesh turns every relay into a new source. In the fix track, keep the
propagation gate closed, remove the `SANDBOX_ONLY` build flag, and erase the
reserved sector so no node can be seeded again.

### 4. Fail safe

Loss of the mesh link or a fault must leave the latch in the safe state.
`monitor_check_link` calls `monitor_fail_safe` when the link goes silent for
`TAMPER_ALERT_WAIT_MS`, which drives the fail-safe zone and seats the latch
closed. `latch_init` seats the latch closed at boot. Re-run the link-loss test:
pull the gateway and watch the latch seat and the fault latch, with the zone
returned to `0`.

### 5. Contain the worm

The worm is a build-time and network problem, so the fix is a build-time and
network control:

- Do not define `SANDBOX_ONLY` in production. The clean build has no worm.
- Erase the reserved sector so no persisted state can re-install the payload.
- Treat the firmware image as a signed artifact and verify it before flashing.
- At runtime, never re-broadcast an untrusted frame; route every move through the
  guarded, authorized command path and record who authorized it.
- In production, burn the RP2350 secure-boot and debug-disable settings in OTP so
  SWD cannot read or write SRAM on a deployed controller.

### The fix-track checklist

- Sealed command path: authenticate the frame, guard the command set and the zone
  band, verify the sequence and the state tag.
- Arm authorization: request, do not bypass.
- No re-broadcast: the node never relays a frame it did not authorize.
- Fail safe: seat the latch on boot, on link loss, and on every fault, and return
  the fail-safe zone.
- Propagation removal: close the gate, erase the reserved sector, and remove the
  code path.
- Build integrity: no `SANDBOX_ONLY` in production, sign and verify images.
- Debug lockdown: OTP debug disable on the deployed part.
- Key lifecycle: provision the field key from OTP and rotate on a schedule.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| No `BOOT` on the console | Wrong console pins / not reset | Check UART0 GP0/GP1 or USB; press RESET |
| `INIT FAIL` with no `0x27` in the scan | LCD not answering | Check LCD VCC=3.3V, SDA=GP2, SCL=GP3, contrast pot |
| LCD shows blocks / nothing | Contrast or address | Turn the backpack contrast pot; confirm address `0x27` vs `0x3F` |
| Cabinet temperature always bad | DHT11 not reading | Check DATA=GP4; add 10K pull-up to 3.3V; wait 1-2 s after power-up |
| IR remote does nothing | Receiver wiring or remote protocol | Check OUT=GP5, VCC=3.3V; confirm the remote is NEC-compatible |
| Latch will not move on a remote command | Command guard, band, or tag | Confirm the gateway holds the field key and the zone is inside 0 to 16 |
| `AT+SEND` sent but gateway sees nothing | Radio unpowered / wrong band | **Power VDD**, attach antenna, use matching band modules |
| Gateway sees nothing but `+OK` | Address/network mismatch | Confirm gateway radio provisioned to `AT+ADDRESS=1`, `AT+NETWORKID=18` |
| `tamper_log.csv` stays empty while `+RCV` prints | Gateway parser regression | Ensure `_split_payload` checks the comma at the declared length |
| Command rejected on the controller | Tag, window, command guard, or band | Check the field key matches, the sequence is newer, and the zone is in band |
| LCD shows `I:INF` while nothing looks wrong | Infection marker present (SANDBOX_ONLY build) | The worm has written the marker; see Lab 3C |
| `IRONWEB` frame appears on the mesh | Worm propagation (SANDBOX_ONLY build) | Expected in the malware-track build; see Lab 3 |
| Marker reappears after a reflash | Reserved-sector persistence | The payload is still in the reserved sector; erase it and close the gate (Lab 3) |
| Debugger changes worm behavior | CoreDebug `DHCSR` anti-debug | The worm suppresses itself while a probe is attached; see Lab 3D |
| Node relays a frame it should not | Untrusted re-broadcast | In production never define `SANDBOX_ONLY`; see Lab 4 |

<br>

## Testing Philosophy and Coverage

Hardware bugs are expensive to find on the bench, so the firmware is written so
that almost all of it can be tested on the host. The suite compiles the real
`src/*.c` files against mock Pico SDK headers (`test/mock/`), replacing GPIO,
I2C, UART, and time with deterministic fakes, and it compiles `src/implant.c`
with a host mock for the CoreDebug `DHCSR` register and the reserved flash
sector.

- The mock GPIO can replay a recorded DHT11 waveform as an absolute time/level
  timeline, so the exact edge-timing decoder is exercised without a sensor.
- The mock I2C records every LCD byte, so rendered text can be decoded and
  asserted.
- The mock UART records outbound `AT+SEND` bytes and injects inbound `+RCV` lines,
  so the arm-to-gateway-to-latch path runs end to end with no radio.
- The implant host mock lets the tests set the `DHCSR` anti-debug bits and read
  and write the reserved-sector marker without touching real silicon, and it
  exposes the propagation transmit path so the `IRONWEB` frame can be asserted.

Run the native test suite:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_tests.py
```

Or configure via CMake and CTest:

```bash
cmake -S test -B build-test -G Ninja && cmake --build build-test && ctest --test-dir build-test --output-on-failure
```

The suite has **141 cases** and **458 checks** with **0 failures**, covering the
full DHT11 waveform and every timeout shape, the latch state machine and its
bounded travel, the sealed command path and its guards, the authorization window
and state tag, the arm no-bypass path, fail-safe on link loss, the
declared-length parser with hex-bearing payloads, the cryptographic primitives
against published vectors, and the complete worm: `IRONWEB` magic matching,
frame construction, propagation gating, write-once infection, re-install on boot,
and anti-debug.

Verify **100% line coverage** of owned firmware modules:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_coverage.py
```

The coverage report shows **2052 / 2052 lines, 100.00%**. `main.c` is excluded
from coverage by design. The Python adapter suite (`test/test_field_crypto.py`
and `test/test_tamper_node.py`) adds 17 more tests, including the RFC 9106
Argon2id known-answer test.

The harness itself is a small in-repo framework (`test/harness/`) so the repo
vendors no third-party code and every owned file obeys the coding standard.

<br>

## Generating Packet Artifacts

`scripts/gen_packet.py` writes the build-time generated header from the JSON
artifact:

- `scripts/packet_artifact.json` is the source of truth.
- `include/packet_artifact.h` is the generated header, committed for the build
  guardrail.

Why these constants are compiled into firmware:

- The RP2350 firmware has no runtime JSON parser or filesystem on this path.
- `include/packet_artifact.h` is generated from the JSON so the frame size, node
  id, gateway address, wait time, servo pulses, DHT timeout, and provisioning
  constants are embedded in flash.
- This is provisioned data; regenerate whenever you rotate node identity,
  gateway addressing, or key material.

To sync the committed header from the JSON artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/gen_packet.py --from-json scripts/packet_artifact.json --header-out include/packet_artifact.h
```

The `check_packet_artifact_header` CMake target fails the build when the
committed header is stale.

<br>

## Code Standards

This repository enforces unusually strict standards because the point is to
teach disciplined embedded and tooling practice, not just working code.

### C standard

- Every function body has **no blank lines**.
- Every function body is **at most eight lines** (Doxygen comment blocks and
  lone braces excluded).
- Every file, function, macro, type, and struct member carries Doxygen
  `@brief` documentation.
- Naming: `snake_case` files/functions, `UPPER_SNAKE` macros, `snake_case_t`
  types.

Run the C audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_c_standard.py
```

### Python standard

- Strict PEP8, four-space indents, `snake_case`, 79-character lines.
- Every function has a NumPy-style docstring.
- Every function executable body is **at most eight lines**, with no exceptions.
- No blank lines inside function bodies.

Run the Python audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_python_standard.py
```

Both audits must report nothing.

## Glossary

- **AEAD**: authenticated encryption with associated data; one operation for
  secrecy and integrity.
- **Anti-debug**: a check that detects an attached debugger and changes behavior.
  Here it reads CoreDebug `DHCSR` at `0xE000EDF0` (bits `C_DEBUGEN` and
  `C_HALT`).
- **Anti-replay window**: a monotonic sequence rule that rejects a valid frame
  that has already been used.
- **Argon2id**: the memory-hard password hash (RFC 9106) used to derive the field
  key.
- **AT command**: a short ASCII command (`AT+...`) understood by the radio.
- **Declared length**: the byte count the sender claims for a payload; the
  receiver slices exactly that many characters.
- **DHT11**: a low-cost temperature/humidity sensor using a custom one-wire
  protocol, used here as the cabinet temperature sensor.
- **Fail safe**: a fault drives the latch closed and returns the fail-safe zone,
  the safe asset state.
- **Field key**: the key that seals frames on the wire and computes the state
  tag.
- **HD44780**: the character-LCD controller inside a 1602 module.
- **I2C**: a two-wire bus (SDA/SCL) used here for the LCD backpack.
- **Implant**: code that runs on the device but is not part of its intended
  function. Here the SANDBOX_ONLY FROSTLINE worm.
- **Infection marker**: the `0xC7` byte the worm writes into the reserved sector.
- **Latch**: the servo-driven shutter this node actuates.
- **LoRa**: a long-range, low-power sub-GHz radio modulation.
- **Magic**: a fixed byte string that a payload matches to identify its own
  frame. Here the 7-byte `IRONWEB` preamble.
- **Mesh**: a radio network in which nodes can hand frames to one another.
- **NEC**: the infrared remote encoding the VS1838B decodes.
- **PCF8574**: an I2C I/O expander that drives the LCD's parallel interface.
- **Propagation**: a payload copying itself from one node to the next over the
  network.
- **Reserved sector**: the final flash sector at `0x103FF000`, used here to hold
  the one-byte infection marker.
- **Rootkit**: code that hides its own activity from the operator.
- **SANDBOX_ONLY**: the build guard that compiles the benign worm. The clean
  firmware does not define it.
- **State tag**: a keyed tag over the authorization record that detects a
  tampered verdict.
- **UART**: a serial port used to talk to the radio.
- **Worm**: a payload that copies itself to other hosts over a network.
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305**: the AEAD used for every sealed frame, with a 192-bit
  nonce and a 128-bit tag.
